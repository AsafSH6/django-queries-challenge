## Notes
* Avoid searching the internet and use the sources
* Some tests may require a change of the test result itself in order to meet the requirement for a specific number of queries
* After you successfully finish the challenge create new test that requires function which was not used in any of the previous tests and send to me
* If you are having troubbles feel free contact me for questions
* You can ask for hints
